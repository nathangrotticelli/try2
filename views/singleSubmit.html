I hate it when that happens. But seriously folks,  who doesn't love a good, old-fashioned tale about the elderly escaping form prison? It's going to be \"gray\"t!\n\n\n                            \"Hipster: The Musical\" \n                        Written by Alexander Hehr\n                         Directed by Kate Busselle  \n\nAre they hipster or homeless? What's so important about Starbucks?  These questions are answered and asked in this brand new musical, focusing around a young woman finding herself thrown into the hipster cult-ure with no signs of escaping.\n\nTickets are FREE. Donations very much appreciated. \nConcessions will be sold between shows. \n\nWe hope to see you there!"
